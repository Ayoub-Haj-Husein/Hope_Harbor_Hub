# Hope_Harbor_Hub

Idea: Create a web platform that enables individuals and organizations
to donate used items they no longer need. Users can upload pictures
of the items they wish to donate, along with details about their
condition and location.

Target Audience:

Individuals who want to dispose of their used items sustainably.

Institutions and companies looking to donate old equipment and
furniture for charitable purposes.

Beneficiaries in need of these items, such as low-income families and
non-profit organizations.
